# Blockchain-proposal
OUR PROPOSAL:
The current offline election process has many disadvantages. So we try to make the election system online. We plan on developing a web portal using Azure Blockchain infrastructure for completely digitising the voting process in a democracy.

•	The problem which people think with online is that the system may be hacked and the system lacks transparency. So we introduce Block-chain to make the online system Transparent, Secure, Reliable Transparent. It means a voter knows that his vote is counted and not tampered by any means, Blockchain ensures this, as the whole chain is transparent and the public ledger is visible to everyone. They can see at all times what is going on with their vote.

•	In offline voting, the poll booth can be quite far away and people have to stand in line for quite a bit of time. By making the process online and securing it with Blockchain. Voters can now vote in the comfort of their homes within just 5 min. Also in the public ledger each voter's vote stays anonymous thereby improving reliability. Each voter can vote as many times as they want but only their last vote will be counted. 

•	Blockchain in itself is secure as any change if made in the chain has to approved by at least 50% people in the public ledger. Supposedly, if anyone does tamper with the data in a block the hash value changes and he has to tamper with all the other blocks too which is impossible. 

•	We often see in the news that a particular place the election process has been non- democratic, i.e voters were not free to choose whom to vote, they were threatened by the people there or offered some money etc. When we get to know about this it generally becomes late and we can't do anything about it. But here after the complete voting process, the Blockchain obtained isn't the final one. The final chain will be created from the existing chain after proper scrutiny of the process, if there has been any malpractice at any region the election process will be repeated over there. In the online process, voter can see the individual agendas and promises of the political parties but this comes under front-end development and not Blockchain.
